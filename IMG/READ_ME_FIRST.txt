The project doesn't really does much other than Signup and login.
And even in it I just made the collection save the data and retrieve it later.


Use local host 5000.

To Sign Up click on the Sign up heading in the last panel, which will redirect you to other page.

To login fill email and password and click Login. This will show you a message which can be found in my app.js

Please keep in mind that after signing up the terminal will show error. But Don't worry, The data is being saved. You can check this by restarting the server.

Please keep in mind I started to learn Web Development from 3 march and Did this in just 2 weeks.
